I want to talk to you again for a little while, dear Mr. Kappus, although
there is almost nothing I can say that will help you, and I can hardly find one
useful word. You have had many sadnesses, large ones, which passed. And you
say that even this passing was difficult and upsetting for you. But please, ask
yourself whether these large sadnesses haven’t rather gone right through you.
Perhaps many things inside you have been transformed; perhaps somewhere,
deep inside your being, you have undergone important changes while you were
sad. The only sadnesses that are dangerous and unhealthy are the ones that we
carry around in public in order to drown them out with the noise; like diseases
that are treated superficially and foolishly, they just withdraw and after a short
interval break out again all the more terribly; and gather inside us and are life, are
life that is unlived, rejected, lost, life that we can die of. If only it were possible
for us to see farther than our knowledge reaches, and even a little beyond the
outworks of our presentiment, perhaps we would bear our sadnesses with greater
trust than we have in our joys. For they are the moments when something new
has entered us, something unknown; our feelings grow mute in shy embarrassment,
everything in us withdraws, a silence arises, and the new experience,
which no one knows, stands in the midst of it all and says nothing.
It seems to me that almost all our sadnesses are moments of tension, which
we feel as paralysis because we no longer hear our astonished emotions living.
Because we are alone with the unfamiliar presence that has entered us; because
everything we trust and are used to is for a moment taken away from us; because
we stand in the midst of a transition where we cannot remain standing. That is
why the sadness passes: the new presence inside us, the presence that has been
added, has entered our heart, has gone into its innermost chamber and is no
longer even there, — is already in our bloodstream. And we don’t know what it
was. We could easily be made to believe that nothing happened, and yet we have
changed, as a house that a guest has entered changes. We can’t say who has come,
perhaps we will never know, but many signs indicate that the future enters us in
this way in order to be transformed in us, long before it happens. And that is why
it is so important to be solitary and attentive when one is sad: because the
seemingly uneventful and motionless moment when our future steps into us is so
much closer to life than that other loud and accidental point of time when it
happens to us as if from outside. The quieter we are, the more patient and open
we are in our sadnesses, the more deeply and serenely the new presence can enter
us, and the more we can make it our own, the more it becomes our fate; and later
on, when it “happens” (that is, steps forth out of us to other people), we will feel
related and close to it in our innermost being. And that is necessary. It is necessary
— and toward this point our development will move, little by little — that
nothing alien happen to us, but only what has long been our own. People have
already had to rethink so many concepts of motion; and they ill also gradually
come to realize that what we call fate does not come into us from the outside, but
emerges from us. It is only because so many people have not absorbed and
transformed their fates while they were living in them that they have not realized
what was emerging from them; it was so alien to them that they have not realized
what was emerging from them; it was so alien to them that, in their confusion
and fear, they thought it must have entered them at the very moment they
became aware of it, for they swore they had never before found anything like that
inside them. Just as people for a long time had a wrong idea about the sun’s
motion, they are even now wrong about the motion of what is to come. The
future stands still, dear Mr. Kappus, but we move in infinite space.
How could it not be difficult for us?
And to speak of solitude again, it becomes clearer and clearer that fundamentally
this is nothing that one can choose or refrain from. We are solitary. We
can delude ourselves about this and act as if it were not true. That is all. But how
much better it is to recognize that we are alone; yes, even to begin from this
realization. It will, of course, make us dizzy; for all points that our eyes used to
rest on are taken away from us, there is no longer anything near us, and everything
far away is infinitely far. A man taken out of his room and, almost without
preparation or transition, placed on the heights of a great mountain range, would
feel something like that: an unequalled insecurity, an abandonment to the
nameless, would almost annihilate him. He would feel he was falling or think he
was being catapulted out into space or exploded into a thousand pieces: what a
colossal lie his brain would have to invent in order to catch up with and explain
the situation of his senses. That is how all distances, all measures, change for the
person who becomes solitary; many of these changes occur suddenly and then, as
with the man on the mountaintop, unusual fantasies and strange feelings arise,
which seem to grow out beyond all that is bearable. But it is necessary for us to
experience that too. We must accept our reality as vastly as we possibly can;
everything, even the unprecedented, must be possible within it. This is in the end
the only kind of courage that is required of us: the courage to face the strangest,
most unusual, most inexplicable experiences that can meet us. The fact that
people have in this sense been cowardly has done infinite harm to life; the
experiences that are called “apparitions,” the whole so-called “spirit world,” death,
all these Things that are so closely related to us, have through our daily defensiveness
been so entirely pushed out of life that the senses with which we might have
been able to grasp them have atrophied. To say nothing of God. But the fear of
the inexplicable has not only impoverished the reality of the individual; it has also
narrowed the relationship between one human being and another, which has as it
were been lifted out of the riverbed of infinite possibilities and set down in a
fallow place on the bank, where nothing happens. For it is not only indolence
that causes human relationships to be repeated from case to case with such
unspeakable monotony and boredom; it is timidity before any new, inconceivable
experience, which we don’t think we can deal with. but only someone who is
ready for everything, who doesn’t exclude any experience, even the most incomprehensible,
will live the relationship with another person as something alive and
will himself sound the depths of his own being. for if we imagine this being of
the individual as a larger or smaller room, it is obvious that most people come to
know only one corner of their room, one spot near the window, one narrow strip
on which they keep walking back and forth. In this way they have a certain
security. And yet how much more human is the dangerous insecurity that drives
those prisoners in Poe’s stories to feel out the shapes of their horrible dungeons
and not be strangers to the unspeakable terror of their cells. We, however, are not
prisoners. No traps or snares have been set around us, and there is nothing that
should frighten or upset us. We have been put into life as into the element we
most accord with, and we have, moreover, through thousands of years of
adaptation, come to resemble this life so greatly that when we hold still, through
a fortunate mimicry we can hardly be differentiated from everything around us.
We have no reason to harbor any mistrust against our world, for it is not against
us. If it has terrors, they are our terrors; if it has abysses, these abysses belong to
us; if there are dangers, we must try to love them. And if only we arrange our life
in accordance with the principle which tells us that we must always trust in the
difficult, then what now appears to us as the most alien will become our most
intimate and trusted experience. How could we forget those ancient myths that
stand at the beginning of all races, the myths about dragons that at the last
moment are transformed into princesses? Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are
princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage.
Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless
that wants our love.
So you mustn’t be frightened, dear Mr. Kappus, if a sadness rises in front of
you, larger than any you have ever seen; if an anxiety, like light and cloudshadows,
moves over your hands and over everything you do. You must realize
that something is happening to you, that life has not forgotten you, that it holds
you in its hand and will not let you fall. Why do you want to shut out of your
life any uneasiness, any misery, any depression, since after all you don’t know
what work these conditions are doing inside you? Why do you want to persecute
yourself with the question of where all this is coming from and where it is going?
Since you know, after all, that you are in the midst of transitions and you wished
for nothing so much as to change. If there is anything unhealthy in your reactions,
just bear in mind that sickness is the means by which an organism frees
itself from what is alien; so one must simply help it to be sick, to have its whole
sickness and to break out with it, since that is the way it gets better. In you, dear
Mr. Kappus, so much is happening now; you must be patient like someone who
is sick, and confident like someone who is recovering; for perhaps you are both.
And more: you are also the doctor, who has to watch over himself. But in every
sickness there are many days when the doctor can do nothing but wait. And that
is what you, insofar as you are your own doctor, must now do, more than
anything else.
Don’t observe yourself too closely. Don’t be too quick to draw conclusions
from what happens to you; simply let it happen. Otherwise it will be too easy for
you to look with blame (that is: morally) at your past, which naturally has a share
in everything that now meets you. But whatever errors, wishes, and yearnings of
your boyhood are operating in you now are not what you remember and
condemn. The extraordinary circumstances of a solitary and helpless childhood are so difficult, so complicated, surrendered to so many influences and at the
same time so cut off from all real connection with life that, where a vice enters it,
one may not simply call it a vice. One must be so careful with names anyway; it
is so often the name of an offense that a life shatters upon, not the nameless and
personal action itself, which was perhaps a quite definite necessity of that life and
could have been absorbed by it without any trouble. And the expenditure of
energy seems to you so great only because you overvalue victory; it is not the
“great thing” that you think you have achieved, although you are right about
your feeling; the great thing is that there was already something there which you
could replace that deception with, something true and real. Without this even
your victory would have been just a moral reaction of no great significance; but
in fact it has become a part of your life. Your life, dear Mr. Kappus, which I think
of with so many good wishes. Do you remember how that life yearned out of
childhood toward the “great thing”? I see that it is now yearning forth beyond the
great thing toward the greater one. That is why it does not cease to be difficult,
but that is also why it will not cease to grow.
And if there is one more thing that I must say to you, it is this: Don’t think
that the person who is trying to comfort you now lives untroubled among the
simple and quiet words that sometimes give you much pleasure. His life has
much trouble and sadness, and remains far behind yours. If it were otherwise, he
would never have been able to find those words.
Yours,
Rainer Maria Rilke
